# XMEGA_LABS

All these snippets of code are made to run on an XMEGA128A1U microprocessor.  
Lab 1: GPIO.  
Lab 2: Keypad Interface using GPIO.  
Lab 3: Creating GPIO using EBI.  
Lab 4: USART setup using BR@Y terminal to communicate with PC. Use of interrupts.  
Lab 5: ADC and LCD using EBI. Voltmeter. Uses USART for input.  
Lab 6: Timer Counter and PWM.  
Lab 7: DMA.
